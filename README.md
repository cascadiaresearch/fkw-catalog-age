# False killer whale catalog-derived age estimate summaries
Analysis code for summarizing catalog-derived age estimates of biopsy-sampled false killer whales for Kratofil et al.: *Deriving probabilistic age estimates using common photo-identification catalog information: An application to endangered Hawaiian false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens)* (in review in *Marine Mammal Science*)

Age estimate data are currently being used for on-going analyses, and thus the raw data are not provided in this repository. Examples of the age estimate values that are summarized in the provided code can be found in the accompanying paper (when published). **Note**: the code for constructing age probability distributions will be uploaded in the near future.
